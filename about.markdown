My primary areas of interest include Applied Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.

Web Developer with 3+ years of experience and expertise in LAMP/XAMP and Django-REST Framework. On the other hand, I have gained a good amount of knowledge as well as experience building and organizing projects that revolve around various Neural Network architectures in the past couple of years.

Having a predilection for problem-solving, brainstorming, and exploring different ideas, I often indulge in Hackathons and coding competitions.

I work with the best of my skills, aiming towards learning new things with a motive of augmenting my skills and evolution of the community.

Feel free to connect and chat. Cheers!
