WSL is a tool that enables users to run Bash and core Linux command-line tools on Windows. Ain't that awesome?!

## Introduction

WSL has two different versions namely WSL and WSL 2 where the later one has better overall performance and usability. 

In this tutorial we aim to install WSL 2 instead of WSL.

## Installation

### Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux

```
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

### Check system requriements

There are specific system requirements that need to be fulfilled in order to run WSL 2. A detailed description can be found [here].

To check your version and build number, select `Windows logo key + R`, type `winver`, select `OK`.

### Setting up new distribution

On launching the new Linux distribution, a console window will open and perform some setup operations under the hood for the first time. Subsequent launches should be faster.

## Conclusion

Yay!! You're good to go. Developers can further can setup [Visual Studio Code Remote] to edit files and develop applications on WSL from Windows.
