<meta name="description" content="AMD’s mainstream Ryzen chips are highly disruptive which include several families of various levels of potency. Ryzen chips introduce a completely new motherboard platform, and the processors require different memory and coolers than their predecessors.  Below is a quick breakdown of the different AMD Ryzen processor brackets:     Ryzen 3: Up to 4-core processors.   Ryzen 5: Up to 8-core processors.   Ryzen 7: Up to 16-core processors.   Ryzen 9: Up to 32-core processors.   Threadripper: Up to 64-core processors.   Within each bracket, the processors are named by model number - the higher the model number the more powerful the CPU.  Ryzen CPUs that start with the number two are Zen+ processors, released in 2018 while the third generation CPUs using Zen 2 were released in 2019.  Now, AMD also has CPUs with G as a suffix for graphics which include Vega video processing which means that you can run a system without a dedicated video card.  Coming to socket type, all AMD processors use the same AM4 socket with a few exceptions like Generation 1 and 2 Threadrippers using a TR4 socket and Generation 3 Threadrippers using a TRX4 socket.  Ryzen 3  The Ryzen 3 processors are built for budget-friendly PCs and consumers who don’t use PCs for intensive tasks. All processors in this family i.e. 1000, 2000, and 3000 Series are quad-core with decent game handling capability.  The latest generation chips in this family come with a rocking boost clock speed of 4.0GHz, allowing you to get good performance at the same affordable price.  Ryzen 5  The Ryzen 5 processors are incredible for gaming and are priced aggressively to take on the popular Intel Core i5 family. These processors contain a mix of quadcore and hexacore processors, packed with enough power for intensive applications and tasks like video editing.  Ryzen 7  The Ryzen 7 processors fall in line with Intel Core i7 processors and may be overkill for most people who don’t perform high computation tasks. However, these processors are extremely good for advanced computing in a somewhat affordable price range.  All processors in this family have 8/16 core/thread configuration and the latest generation chips come with massive L3 cache, high clock speeds and great overclock support.  Ryzen 9  The Ryzen 9 processors are the latest batch of processors that are magically packed with 12/24 to 16/32 core/thread configuration. These chips are amazing and lie in the middle-ground between Ryzen 7 and Threadripper.  These processors challenge Intel’s Core i9 processor range and are optimal for gamers, streamers, and content creators.  Threadripper  The Threadripper family is the ultimate CPU one can have which comes with upto 64 cores and 128 threads that allow advanced users to push their systems beyond the limit.">
